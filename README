# Humidity Sensor Statistical Analysis

This notebook performs a rapid and informative statistical analysis of data collected during humidity sensor tests under variable pressure.

## 🔬 Test Context

The test setup is as follows:

- A **humidity sensor** is placed on a **moist wooden block**.
- The block is subjected to **variable mechanical pressure** using a press.
- At each pressure level, the **sensor's voltage output** is recorded.
- The aim is to analyze the correlation between **humidity percentage**, **pressure**, and the resulting **voltage signal**.

## 📊 What the Code Does

1. **Loads Excel data** containing sensor readings.
2. **Cleans and reshapes** the dataset for analysis.
3. Computes **mean, standard deviation, and variance** of voltage values across humidity and pressure combinations.
4. Produces **plots** of voltage response at various pressure levels.
5. Performs **linear regression** at selected pressures to estimate sensitivity.
6. Tries four regression models per pressure level:
   - Linear Regression
   - Polynomial Regression (degree 3)
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
7. Automatically **selects the best-fitting model** using the R² score and visualizes it.

## 📁 Input File Format

Make sure your Excel file (`c.xls`) contains:

- A sheet named `Foglio1`
- A first column representing **Pressure (MPa)**
- Subsequent columns representing different **Humidity levels (%)** and corresponding **Voltage readings**

## 🧰 Dependencies

This code requires the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl
